1. Prerequisites

1.1 Appium Desktop Version - v1.18.0
1.2 Appium Port - 4723
1.3 Set the Java_home and Android_Home path 
1.4 Install node.js 
1.5 Install Android_sdk and install Nexus2 emulator 
1.6 If you are using real android device or different emulator please update the UUID in Test_setup class - > initialization folder.


2. Steps to Execute the Code

2.1 Clone the Project open the project in eclipse IDE
2.2 Run the Appium Server 
2.3 Run the Emulator 
2.4 Open TestNG.XML file 
2.5 Run the project as TestNG Test. 

Note: I have integrated 'Extent reports' to get the HTML format report, but I have commented the code because "BeansWrapperBuilder" issue 
has not resolved from 'Extent Reports' side for the newer version. 


3. Assumption Made - 

3.1 This test is only to verify the login functionality, so just hard coded the data for testing the login feature. 


4. Possible steps to develop the application more robust 

4.1 Add new methods in Base_root class if required for new actions (For ex: Double tap , Switch to Web view etc) and use across the pages. 
4.2 Add different page classes in future to test the application 
4.3 Add in-detail extent report to get the HTML reports 
4.4 Create the API's in case if will plan to store the test cases in DB
4.5 Integrate JIRA API to automate manually created test cases and update the status. 
4.6 Run the application in different OS versions to test the compatibility.
